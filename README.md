Title: Avoid waiting rooms in hospitals

Application name: Healthify (A web based application to help avoid waiting rooms in hospitals)

Description:  
Given the situation of current covid pandemic, health care workers are scarce for the given patient influx. With more number of people hospitalized, small changes may go a big way.

Our solution is to bring waiting times down by getting data from the hospitals for each doctor. A patient would get status of the appointment and avoid a potential transmission of the disease by reducing the time the person spends on the hospital grounds. The data will be updated by the hospital.

This method helps hospitals reduce the crowd present on the hospital grounds by a significant amount since patients have to reach only at their given appointment time. Thus over crowding can be prevented and the crowd can be easily managed.
